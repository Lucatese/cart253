# Dodge-em Exercise
Luca Licatese

This is an exercise I made where the user is tring to avoid catching covid by using the mouse to move avoid the covid circle from touching them while the covid circle chases after them. The game ends once the covid circle touches/infects you.

 The covid image was taken from this website.
