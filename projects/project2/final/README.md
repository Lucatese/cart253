# Project 2: Prototype

In this game, the user is using their mouse to move on the Y-axis to dodge wrenches, bricks and dodgeballs. If the user can keep dodging them for a period of time they'll win. I got the images for all of my assets

I feel that I didn't really reach my goal in the end. I really wanted to it done but due to some unforeseen instances and the amount of work from outside of this class that I didn't expect to have. I feel that I just work better in-class as I just find it a lot easier to focus on tasks more and having a strict time where I could get the most effective work done. I tried to work on some of the code to at least show what a portion of it would look like but then my power went out so this is what I'm left with. It was still a joy to participate in this class and learn more about programming.
