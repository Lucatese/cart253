# Template p5 project

This is my jungle garden exercise where the player has to juggle both a chainsaw and balls. I got the chainsaw noise from https://freesound.org/people/lonemonk/sounds/185578/ and the ball noise from https://freesound.org/people/pbimal/sounds/534110/ . They were both taken from freesounds(Freesound is a collaborative database of Creative Commons Licensed sounds. Browse, download and share sounds.) I got the chainsaw image from https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Chainsaw_symbol_2010-02-16.svg .
